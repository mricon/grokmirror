# Use shell-globbing to list the repositories you would like to mirror.
# If you want to mirror everything, just say "*". Separate multiple entries
# with newline plus tab. Examples:
#
# mirror everything:
#include = *

# mirror just the main kernel sources:
#include = /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
#          /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
#          /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

# mirror just git:
#include = /pub/scm/git/*

# This is processed after the include. If you want to exclude some specific
# entries from an all-inclusive globbing above. E.g., to exclude all linux-2.4

#exclude = */linux-2.4*
