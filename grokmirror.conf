#
# Grokmirror version 2.x and above can automatically recognize related repositories
# by analyzing root commits. If it finds two or more related repositories, it can set
# up a unified "object storage" repo and fetch all refs from each related repository.
# For example, you can have two forks of linux.git:
# foo/bar/linux.git:
#   refs/heads/master
#   refs/heads/devbranch
#   refs/tags/v5.0-rc3
#   ...
# baz/quux/linux.git:
#   refs/heads/master
#   refs/heads/devbranch
#   refs/tags/v5.0-rc3
#   ...
# Grokmirror will set up an object storage repository and fetch all refs from
# both repositories:
# objstore/[random-guid-name].git
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-foo/bar/linux.git:12]/heads/master
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-foo/bar/linux.git:12]/heads/devbranch
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-foo/bar/linux.git:12]/tags/v5.0-rc3
#    ...
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-baz/quux/linux.git:12]/heads/master
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-baz/quux/linux.git:12]/heads/devbranch
#    refs/virtual/[sha1-of-baz/quux/linux.git:12]/tags/v5.0-rc3
#    ...
#
# This will dramatically improve storage on disk, as original repositories will be
# repacked to almost nothing. Grokmirror will repack the object storage repository
# with --delta-islands to help optimize packs for efficient clones.
objstore = ${toplevel}/objstore
#
# When copying objects into objstore repositories, we will use regular git

# git erring on the side of caution when calculating haves and wants, so if you

# direct object copying between repos.
