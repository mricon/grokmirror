.SH SYNOPSIS

grok\-fsck \-c /path/to/fsck.conf

.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Git repositories can get corrupted whether they are frequently updated
or not, which is why it is useful to routinely check them using "git
fsck". Grokmirror ships with a "grok\-fsck" utility that will run "git
fsck" on all mirrored git repositories. It is supposed to be run
nightly from cron, and will do its best to randomly stagger the checks
so only a subset of repositories is checked each night. Any errors will
be sent to the user set in MAILTO.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Locate fsck.conf and modify it to reflect your needs. The default
configuration file is heavily commented.
.sp
Set up a cron job to run nightly and to email any discovered errors to
root:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Make sure MAILTO is set, for error reports
MAILTO=root
# Run nightly, at 2AM
00 02 * * * mirror /usr/bin/grok\-fsck \-c /etc/grokmirror/fsck.conf
.ft P
.fi

.sp
You can force a full run using the \fB\-f\fP flag, but unless you only have
a few smallish git repositories, it\(aqs not recommended, as it may take
several hours to complete, as it will do a full repack, prune and fsck
of all repositories. To make this process faster, you can use:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-connectivity\fP: when doing fsck, only check object connectivity
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-repack\-all\-quick\fP: do a quick repack of all repositories
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-repack\-all\-full\fP: if you have \fBfull_repack_flags\fP defined in
the configuration file, trigger a full repack of every repository.
This can be handy if you need to bring up a newly cloned mirror and
want to make sure it\(aqs repacked and all bitmaps are built before
serving content.
